# Decoder-Ring

Context of Project: This was an assignment in the software engineering program I am in requiring me to write some algorithms for encripting and decripting messages.

My contribution: I developed the algorithms used in the functions in caesar.js, polybius.js, and substitution.js files in the src directory.

Purpose: I completed this project in an earlier stage of my journey of learning to be a software developer and it was for the purpose of gaining experience 
writing algorithms.
